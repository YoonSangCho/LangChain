**LLM,LangChain,ChatGPT**

The module provides an explanation of the core components of LangChain and allows practicing the functions commonly used in these modules. Additionally, each module is practiced individually first, and then an integrated practice code is written to interact with a chatbot using all the core modules.

Finally, the practice code is designed to help trainees achieve goals (1) and (2):

- Goal (1): Creating an OpenAI key for using ChatGPT and adjusting user-selectable variables for ChatGPT responses to compare differences in answers.
- Goal (2): Utilizing all core modules of LangChain. It also assumes a scenario where working students study the latest papers to explore AI methodologies applicable to their work and allows them to ask questions to ChatGPT.
